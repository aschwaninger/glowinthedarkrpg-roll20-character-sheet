# glowinthedarkrpg-roll20-character-sheet
Roll20 character sheet for Glow in the Dark, a post-apocalyptic hack of Blades in the Dark.

The one-page structure is largely necessary due to how Roll20's API limits Javascript usage.

Special thanks to Chris McDonald, Jakob Oesinghaus, and Tim Denee, who worked on the Blades in the Dark sheets and Scum & Villainy sheets.
